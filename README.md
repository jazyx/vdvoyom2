# Vdvoyom
(вдвоём in Russian means "together in pairs")

## Overview

**Vdvyom** is Meteor app for language teachers to play interactive games online with students.
It is principally designed to be used on a smartphone, but it will work in any browser.
It does not provide any video or audio chat features; you can use a social media app at the same time.

First-time visitors will be asked to:

1. Choose their native language
2. Enter a username
3. Choose a language teacher, or a language to learn on their own
4. Choose an activity.

No registration or password is currently required.

### Activities

Currently, Vdvoyom provides a single drag-and-drop vocabulary game, which can be played in 3 different languages.

### Working with a teacher

If you select a teacher, your teacher will be able to see your interactions, and to manipulate the activities on your screen.

### Menu

A slide-out menu allows you to change activity, language, teacher or username.

## Road Map

### Waiting Room

In future versions, your teacher will receive a request to join the group.
While you are waiting for the teacher to accept your request, you will join a Waiting Room group,
where you can chat and form pairs with other students who are waiting.

### Community Room

In future versions, students will also be able to join a Community group with other people who are learning the same language
without a teacher. The features will be the same as those in the Waiting Room.

### Chat

In future versions, you will be able to chat with your teacher,
with other students in your group (class or Waiting Room) both publicly and privately.
