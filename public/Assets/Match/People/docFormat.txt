Changes to User doc format
==========================

1. Move History to separate docs
   { _id: <>
   , user_id: <>
   , group_id: <>
   , start: <>
   , end: <>
   , page: {} // closing state
   }

2. Add most recent group_ids for groups in which user is a member, so that the most recent can be shown as Go back to <xxx>", if there are more than 1.

{ _id:      <>
, fullname: <>
, username: <>
, native:   <>
, q_index:  <>
, q_code:   <>
, q_color:  <>
, group_history: [
    <> // ordered by recency; group knows language and owner/teacher
  ]
, logged_in: ]
    <d_code>
  ]
, view_size: {
    <d_code>: {
      width:       <number>
    , height:      <number>
    , aspectRatio: <number>
    }
  }
}

When we create a User doc, we also create a Group doc with the User as the owner and only member. This acts as the final fallback for when the user's current group closes.

Changes to Group doc format
===========================

Take data out of the page. It doesn't have to be that deep.

{ _id: <>
, name: <>
, owner: <>
, language: <>
, active: <>
, lobby: <>
, chat_room: <>
, ace: <>
, menu_open: <>
, members: [
    <>
  ]
, logged_in: [
    <>
  ]
, page: {
    view: <string | missing>
  , path: <string | missing>
  , tag:  <string | missing>
  , index:<number | missing>
  }
, data: {

  },
, view_size: {
    width:       <number>
  , height:      <number>
  , aspectRatio: <number>
  }
}

A Group where the owner is the only member could be:

* A teacher's group, for a Show
* A user's group for solo study

The difference will be in the type of id: less than 4 letters, or not.


Just knowing the group_id defines the owner and the language.

Device
======
A Device doc will be temporary, and will be destroyed when the user logs off from the device. Page + data will be stored elsewhere.

{ _id:      <d_code>
, user_id:  <>
, group_id: <>
, master:   <d_code>
, view_size: {
    width:       <number>
  , height:      <number>
  , aspectRatio: <number>
  }
}

You log on. An arbitrary d_code is attributed. Let's rename it as device_id.

You log on as a user. You
